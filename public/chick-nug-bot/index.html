            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The day is January 26, 2022. I have been coding for about a year and have became quite good. I decide to start experimenting external API's. I had done it before, making useless Discord bots. But I wanted to try something new. I decided to start experimenting with the Twitter API. Incase you don't know, an API is a way to get and send data to a service (such as Twitter) via code. I spend a while thinking about what I will want it to do, a bot. I think that I should try something simple. And then the idea was born. A Twitter bot that will make a tweet every 30 minutes containing "[number] pc chicken nugget." Every time it tweets, the number goes up. I then get to work.</p>
            <h2>Build-a-bot</h2>
            <p>This section goes into the code of the bot, so if that doesn't interest you, I recommend you skip this.</p>
            <p>I decide that the language that this bot will be written in is Python.</p>
            <h3>The Code</h3>
            <p>The first thing the code will do is login to the api, I will not be showing this, for privacy reasons.</p>
            <p>The first function makes the tweet by making a call to my database, and adding one.</p>
            <blockquote>
                value = db["n"]<br>
                value = value + 1<br>
                db["n"] = value<br>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It then prints the value into the console</p>
            <blockquote>
                print(value)
            </blockquote>
            <p>It then creates the text to tweet.</p>
            <blockquote>
                tweet = ("{} pc chicken nugget".format(value))
            </blockquote>
            <p>The code then makes a call to the Twitter API, to post the tweet.</p>
            <blockquote>
                This code is hidden for privacy.
            </blockquote>
            <p>It then waits 30 minutes.</p>
            <blockquote>
                time.sleep(1800)
            </blockquote>
            <p>It then does it all over again.</p>
            <blockquote>
                new()<br><br>

                def new():<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tweet()
            </blockquote>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Over all, this probably took me 1 hour. I know that probably seems like a lot. But 30-45 minutes were taken just to connect the API. The tutorial I was using was not very recent, and I had to explore deep into documentation.</p>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>At this point, you most likely have asked yourself: why?. And I did this for two reasons:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To practice using API's</li>
                <li>To see what would happen</li>
            </ol>
            <p>While doing this I figured that the two most likely reasons why this will ever stop is that my code will break or Twitter will ban me for spamming. This was just to see what will happen. Only time will show now.</p>
